The libraries 'libblisrc.so' & 'libblisrc32.so' are the audio resampler implementation.
These libraries are pre-built by MediaTek internal.


WHAT IT DOES?
=============

libblisrc.so is an audio resampler, used to transform audio data sampling rate. 
libblisrc.so only supports 16bit audio data format.
libblisrc32.so is an audio resampler, used to transform audio data sampling rate. 
libblisrc32.so can support 16bit/32bit audio data format.

HOW IT WAS BUILT?
==================

It needs the following libs from AOSP:
1.  libnativehelper.so
2.  libcutils.so
3.  libutils.so

and the following libs from MediaTek:
1.  libmtk_drvb.so


HOW TO USE IT?
==============

The library 'libblisrc.so' is be used by
audio hal  to generate an appropriate sampling rate data.
The library 'libblisrc32.so' is be used by
audio hal  to generate an appropriate sampling rate data.

All the source code of this library were written by MediaTek co..
