3.  libcutils.so

and the following libs from MediaTek:
1.  libimageio_plat_drv.so
2.  libcam.halsensor.so
3.  libimageio.so
4.  libcam.metadata.so
5.  libcamdrv.so
6.  libdpframework.so
7.  libJpgEncPipe.so
8.  libcam_hwutils.so
9.  libcam_utils.so

All source/dependency modules of this module are already put in
'vendor\mediatek\proprietary\hardware\mtkcam\legacy\platform\mtxxx\core' folder.

==============

Provide api for camera HAL to control the camera features.
all api interface are at (vendor\mediatek\proprietary\hardware\mtkcam\legacy\platform\mtxxx\include\mtkcam\iopipe)
