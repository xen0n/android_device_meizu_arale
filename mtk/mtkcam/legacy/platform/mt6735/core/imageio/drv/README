1.  liblog.so
2.  libcutils.so
3.  libstlprot.so
3.  libutils.so

and the following libs from MediaTek:
1.  libcamdrv.so
2.  libm4u.so
3.  libdpframework.so

All source/dependency modules of this module are already put in
'vendor\mediatek\proprietary\platform\mtxxx\hardware\mtkcam\core' folder.

HOW TO USE IT?
==============
Provide api for ISP normal path driver to control ISP internal driver.
all api interface are at (vendor\mediatek\proprietary\platform\mtxxx\hardware\include\mtkcam\imageio)
